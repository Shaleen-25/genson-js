# genson-js

**genson-js** is a user-friendly **JSON Schema** generator built in TypeScript/JavaScript.

.. note::
This is _not_ the JavaScript equivalent of the **Java Genson library**.
The motivation for this library was to port [GenSON](https://github.com/cequencer/GenSON) python library to JS, however having the same api or possiblities was not a goal.

genson-js's core function is to take JSON objects and generate schemas that describe them, with an ability to **merge** schemas.
